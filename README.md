Vim integration of [fixjson][]
==============================

This is a Vim plugin for [fixjson][]. fixjson is a JSON fixer/formatter using
[(relaxed) JSON5](https://github.com/rhysd/json5).

This plugin automatically fixes a JSON file asynchronously on saving the file while editing.

- Pretty-printing JSON5 input
  - ES5 syntax is available to write up
- Fixes various failures while humans writing JSON
  - Fixes trailing commas objects or arrays
  - Fixes missing commas for elements of objects or arrays
  - Adds quotes to keys in objects
  - Newlines in strings
  - Hex numbers
  - Fixes single quotes to double quotes
- Fixing/Formatting is done asynchronously. So it does not block user input (e.g. moving cursor)

## Screenshots

When moving a line to another line, you no longer need to care about a trailing comma:

And you also don't need to care about a trailing comma of previous line when adding a new element
to an object or an array:

![add key](https://github.com/rhysd/ss/raw/master/fixjson/addkey.gif)

When adding a new key-value to an object, quotes of the key are fixed. And single quotes for strings
are also fixed to double quotes:

JSON string does not allow multi-line string. `\n` is required to embed multi-line string to JSON.
fixjson automatically fixes newlines in strings. This is useful when copy&paste some string to JSON
file:

JSON only accepts decimal digits for numbers. fixjson automatically converts `0x` hex numbers to
decimal numbers. You no longer need to convert hex numbers manually:

And of course it pretty-prints the JSON code, with automatic indent detection:

## Installation

Please use your favorite plugin manager or Vim standard `:packopt` to install.

For example (neobundle.vim):

```vim
call neobundle#add('rhysd/vim-fixjson', {
            \ 'lazy' : 1,
            \ 'autoload' : {
            \     'filetypes' : 'json'
            \   }
            \ })
```

If [fixjson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fixjson) is not installed globally, vim-fixjson installs
it locally to `/path/to/vim-fixjson/node_modules` using npm pacakge manager. So you don't need to
install fixjson command manually.

## Usage

Auto-fix on saving a JSON file is enabled by default. And you can also run a `fixjson` formatter by
`:FixJson` command.

If you want to update local `fixjson` command, run `:FixJsonUpdateLocalCommand`.

Asynchronous formatting is implemented with [Vital.Async.Promise][] and [Vital.System.Job][].
It requires modern Vim or Neovim (Vim 8.0.27+ or Neovim 0.2.0+). If the requirements are not met,
it falls back to synchronous formatting.

If you want to format JSON only manually with `:FixJson`, please set `g:fixjson_fix_on_save` to `0`.

If you want to specify an indent size explicitly, set the number to `g:fixjson_indent_size`.
By default, `fixjson` detects an indent size automatically.
